Drag and drop any .UEXP file to the batch script

This will create a "tabular_raw_bytes.csv" file no matter what happens, and if all goes well it should also generate a "tabular_parsed.csv". If any errors occur, please ping me with the file!

I have included ALL uexp files in which you may test.

big_run.py runs all .uexp files through the parser, and creates corresponding files in the csv_outputs folder. THIS WILL NOT REPLACE FILES, PLEASE DELETE THE CONTENTS OF CSV_OUTPUTS IF YOU WANT NEWER FILES.

If you are interested in datamining yourself, please DM me!
